# All New Retro Snake

Welcome to the repository for All New Retro Snake, a modern and enhanced take on the classic snake game we all know and love. The game is developed using Flutter. This repository contains the source code for the game, and you are more than welcome to review, comment, or even contribute to it.

## Current State of Work

As of the current release, version 0.1.0, the game is only available on the web. However, I am fervently working towards extending its accessibility to both Android and iOS platforms. You can play the current web version of the game by visiting my website [here](https://allnewretrosnake.com/#/).

## Setup

Please note that after cloning the repository, the project won't run immediately. This is because the Firebase configuration files are committed out for security reasons. You will need to set up your own Firebase project and add your own configuration files to get the game running. For detailed instructions on how to do this, please refer to the Firebase documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

## Future Plans

Stay tuned for more updates and future releases of the game. I am continuously working on improving and expanding its features. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on the current version, and hope you are as excited as I am for the upcoming Android and iOS versions!
