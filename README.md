# All New Retro Snake

Welcome to the repository for All New Retro Snake, a modern and enhanced take on the classic snake game we all know and love. The game is developed using Flutter. This repository contains the source code for the game, and you are more than welcome to review, comment, or even contribute to it.

## Current State of Work

As of the current release, version 0.4.0, the game is only available on the web. You can play the current web version of the game by visiting my website: [https://allnewretrosnake.com](https://allnewretrosnake.com/#/).

## Setup

Please note that after cloning the repository, the project won't run immediately. This is because the Firebase configuration files are committed out for security reasons. To run project you have to rename file `firebase_options_fake.dart` to `firebase_options.dart`, the file is in `lib/firebase` folder. You can also set up your own Firebase project. For detailed instructions on how to do this, please refer to the Firebase documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

To run the app use the following command:
`flutter run -d chrome`

## Future Plans

Plenty of things can be improved!

### Possible improvements

- the game logic is a little messy, it should be refactored
- adding gameplay improving functionalities
